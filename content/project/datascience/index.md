This website contains all materials used in BIOL 01301 Spring 2020 at Rowan University with Dr. Spielman. This course now meets remotely, but used to meet Monday 12:30-1:45 in SCI 239, Wednesday 12:30-1:45 in SCI 226, and Thursday 11-1:45 in SCI 239. 

**All grading and assignment submissions (unless otherwise stated) will be hosted on [Blackboard](https://rowan.blackboard.com/), but course materials will be posted on this site and/or within the [rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) BIOL01301 space.**
