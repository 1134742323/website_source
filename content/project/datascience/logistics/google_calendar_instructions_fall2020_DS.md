# Google Calendar Instructions

**Preface notes**

+ Use Google Chrome Browser (NOT internet explorer! NOT Safari!) from a COMPUTER (NOT a mobile device!!) for all calendar use. This will make your life significantly easier.
+ You must also be logged in to Chrome with your Rowan account to access the calendar. 
<!--
+ I strongly recommend you add the Google Calendar app to your Slack. It will alert you of your appointments you make on Google Calendar, *and it will provide your video meeting link!*
+ Please refer all questions to the Slack channel `#logistical-questions`
-->

1. Navigate to [https://calendar.google.com/calendar/](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/). To view our class calendar, you will need to add the class calendar to your account. The link to add the class calendar is in Canvas. Please do not share the calendar link with anyone outside of class!!

2. You will see several types of (virtual!) calendar events:
	+ **Assignment Due**: Assignment deadlines will be visible in the calendar
	+ **Data Science Class**: Monday/Thursday 2-3:15 and Wednesday 3:30-6:15 represent our class meeting times and contain links to our Zoom classes. *If Zoom is down that day, please use the back-up WebEx link in Canvas.*
	+ **Data Science Open Office Hours:** On Tuesday from 2-3 pm, there will be virtual open office hours on Zoom. No appointment necessary - just come join to ask questions or code together!
	+ **Data Science Appointment Office Hours:** On Tuesdays from 3-4:15 pm, there are office hours by-appointment *only* .

3. **For Appointment Office Hours**, you can request one or more 15-minute blocks to Zoom with me one-on-one or with small group. To book your meeting:
	+ Click the event itself within the calendar. In the pop-up window for the event, there will be a link that reads "Go to appointment page for this calendar". Click that link. 
	+ You will be redirected to a page displaying slots in 15-minute increments during the whole 1.5 hour window. Select one slot or two consecutive slots to reserve for a meeting. Click the meeting slot, and in the pop-up window that appears simply click "Save." At this point I will be notified that you have booked a meeting. You will receive an email when I have approved this meeting. Once I approve the meeting, I will add a meeting-specific Zoom link to the calendar event. If you have selected *two* back-to-back time slots, only the first time slot will have a Zoom link.
	+ At the time of your meeting, return to the google calendar app and click on your appointment event, which will now exist as its own event within the main calendar page. Within your meeting details, there will be a new link "Join Zoom Meeting." Join the meeting through the link provided!
	+ If you want to do this with MULTIPLE people, please designate one person to make the appointment. They should share the meeting link with other participants. Please either add a note to the calendar event or reach out to me to let me know that we are expecting multiple people.
