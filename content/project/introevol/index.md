This website contains all materials used in BIOL 01104 Section 4, Spring 2020 at Rowan University with Dr. Spielman. This course meets Monday/Wednesday 11-12:15 and Friday 11:00 am-1:45 pm in Science Hall 239.

**All grading and assignments (unless otherwise stated) will be hosted on [Blackboard](https://rowan.blackboard.com/), but in-class materials and scheduling will be posted on this site.**


## Key documents and links

+ [**Download the course syllabus**](./logistics/Spring2020_Spielman_Syllabus_Evolution.pdf). This document contains all course policies. *When in doubt, check here first*.

+ [**Download the regrade form**](./logistics/regrade_policy.docx). This form may be used to request a formal regrade on an assignment or exam. Please consult this document for instructions.

+ [**Link to required CITI Laboratory Safety Training Instructions**](https://research.rowan.edu/officeofresearch/compliance/cititraining/index.html). You must complete "General Biological Laboratory Research" and "General Laboratory Safety Training." If you already have an up-to-date certificate, don't retake the trainings, and don't do other trainings you don't need!

+ **Student Visiting Hours** will be held *Wednesday and Thursday in Science Hall 201D from 2:30 - 4 pm*. You do not need to make an appointment. To speak with me one-on-one with a guarantee of privacy, please set up an appointment with me via [email](mailto:spielman@rowan.edu).
