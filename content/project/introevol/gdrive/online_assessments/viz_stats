Researchers conduct aï»¿clinical trial to test hypothesis, "Coconut oil applied topically (to the skin) can reduce acne in teenagers." They randomly place 200 individuals ranged 12-18 into two groups of 100, where the first group applies daily coconut oil, and the second group applies daily baby oil (as a control). After two weeks, they determine whether each individual has improved, become worse, or remained unchanged in their level of ance. They found that 75 individuals applying coconut oil improved 15 stayed the same, and 10 got worse. They found that 35 individuals applying baby oil stayed the same, 32 improved, and 33 got worse.

Researchers design an experiment to test the hypothesis that acorns use nitrogen from the soil during growth into an oak tree. They design replicated plots of land where half the plots are enriched for a nitrogen isotope (N15) and half the plots contain only regular nitrogen (N14). They randomly plant one acorn in each plot. After one year, they measure the nitrogen composition of the (small!) oak trees that have emerged. If trees contain N15, then we can infer that they used nitrogen from the soil and not from, for example, the atmosphere. If trees contain little-to-no N15, then we can infer that they did not use soil nitrogen.
The researchers measured the percent of nitrogen that was N15 in each plant and obtained the following data.

Plants from treatment plots: 85, 92, 87, 74, 91, 68
Plants from control plots: 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 1.2
