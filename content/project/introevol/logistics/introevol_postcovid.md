# Updated Information for `Introduction to Evolution and Scientific Inquiry (Section 4, Spring 2020)`

## \textcolor{red}{READ THE CONTENTS OF THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY. Please post questions or clarifications in the \#logistical-questions Slack channel.}


**If you have not yet joined the class Slack workspace, please do so ASAP:**

+ [Link to join class workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/intro-evolution/shared_invite/zt-cnpdin7o-cevlNjvGbuBjAC5JYY5DWQ)
+ Please download the Slack app for your computer and phone - will be very helpful and is WAY better than the browser version.

## Weekly class

+ Every week, you can expect 1-3 lecture videos to debut **each Monday** with that week's materials, and two assignments due each week, with deadlines spread out on **Thursdays at 11:59 pm** and **Sundays at 11:59 pm** (more info in next section). 
+ As before, materials will be hosted on the class website [here](https://spielmanlab.github.io/courses/introevol/), and submissions will be on Blackboard.


## Updated Grading Scheme

Your final grade will now be determined from the following:

+ First Midterm (15%)
+ Assignments (85%)


#### Details on assignments

+ You will stop drop the lowest grade!!
+ In the end, there will be **15** assignments total, meaning each assignment is ~5.6% of your final grade (16 listed below, you drop the lowest automatically):
	+ Already assigned (6)
		+ Proof of Safety Training Submission 
		+ Termite Lab
		+ Stickleback Lab
		+ EvoDots Activity
		+ Concepts in Natural Selection "Quiz"
		+ Population Genetics Assignment
	+ **10** assignment grades will be forthcoming after break.
		+ There will be two assignments each week, due respectively on Thursdays at 11:59 pm and Sundays at 11:59 pm (it will be clear which is which!). Effectively, in-class worksheets (as well as existing HW assignments that would have been assigned anyways) will be converted to smaller assignments. This will ensure regular engagement with material. 
		+ The final assignment will count DOUBLE AS TWO ASSIGNMENTS (aka a total of ~11% to your final grade, still less than a real exam at 15%!), and will be analogous in SCOPE (aka, it is cumulative) to a final exam. 

+ You will be organized into Teams for the rest of the semester so you have a stable group to work on assignments with. You are always welcome to work with those students outside your team, but you are **strongly encouraged** to coordinate with your formal team members as working groups. You will receive information within the next week about who is in your Team (yes, I am picking for you).
+ Please assume the following rules for all upcoming submissions:

	+ Open-note, open-book, open-friends! *Be careful with the internet* - the temptation to use random internet materials and videos will be much higher. Please use the `#resources` channel to ask me if materials you find are legit!!
	+ As always you must submit YOUR OWN WORK IN YOUR OWN WORDS (including teams - each team member should present their OWN work).



<!-- 
The two associated assignments for that week's materials will then generally be due on these two dates (it will be clear which is due when!) on Blackboard as usual:
	+ **Thursday by 11:59 pm** 
	+ **Sunday by 11:59 pm** 
-->

## Communication


### Virtual Meetings
+ There will be two kinds of office hours, for which all scheduling will be done via **Google Calendar**. Join the calendar [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=c3R1ZGVudHMucm93YW4uZWR1X3VwdTZ2Y3BqOWc4bTlra3ZkczhjaGE2bHNrQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20) (you must be logged into your Rowan account). Please use the GOOGLE CHROME BROWSER!! Not Internet Explorer, not Safari, not Firefox - they are not guaranteed to work cleanly with the Google services that we will use. Associated with each appointment will be a **Google Hangouts Link** to join.
	+ Every **Wednesday from 1-2:30 pm** there will be an open session for anyone to join. Links to join these meetings will be embedded in the calendar event.
	+ Every **Tuesday 1-2:30 pm** and **Friday 1-2:30 pm** there will be opportunities to book individual (or team!!!) remote meetings with me, again via the class google calendar. These bi-weekly events are scheduled in the calendar. To make an appointment, click the event, and then click "Go to appointment page for this calendar." You can then book 1 or more (but please don't overbook!!) 15-minute time slots. Once you have made an appointment and I am notified, I will be able to turn on a Google Hangout link for the meeting. Make sure to book meetings in a timely fashion!!
	+ If you are unable to make any of those times, please DM me on Slack and we will find another suitable time to meet.
	+ To facilitate scheduling, I highly recommend you install the "Google Calendar" app to your Slack. See [here](https://slack.com/apps/ADZ494LHY-google-calendar?next_id=0) for information.



##### For other types of communication (questions, emails), please default to the Slack Workspace for all communications:

+ DM me on the app for indiviualized conversation. If any conversation appears important enough to merit being on email, I will transition the conversation accordingly.
+ Use the `#channels` to direct flow of information and general discussions (topics below represent what we will be covering for the rest of the semester)
	+ `#general`: The baseline place to ask questions when there is no other specific # channel more appropriate.
	+ `#logistical-questions`: Questions about deadlines and similar class logistics
	+ `#random`: Fun and at least marginally relevant things (memes? articles? whatever!) you find that would be fun to share with the class. **Keep this SFW**.
	+ `#assignments`: Questions that pertain to weekly assignments should go here. **All questions about completing assignment questions should be directed here!!** Previous rules of "only use email for logistical questions rather than content questions" are now suspended. Use this channel!!!
	+ `#resources`: Questions about whether a specific resource you have found is ok to use! 
	+ `#speciation`: Questions that specifically pertain to speciation, reproductive isolation, etc. *Not for specific assignment questions.*
	+ `#phylogenetics`: Questions that specifically pertain to interpreting and using phylogenetic trees and/or working with character matrices/sequence alignments. *Not for specific assignment questions.*
	+ `#biogeography`: Questions that specifically pertain to biogeography (includes "phylogenetics of speciation" content). *Not for specific assignment questions.*
	+ `#pathogen-evolution`: Questions that specifically pertain to pathogen evolution _and their associated phylogenetics_. *Not for specific assignment questions.*
	+ `#origins-transitions`: Questions that specifically pertain to origins of life and major evolutionary transitions, including fossils. *Not for specific assignment questions.*
	+ `#human-evolution`: Questions that specifically pertain to human origins and evolution. *Not for specific assignment questions.*

+ Protip! For each message you send to a `#channel`, there is an option to reply directly and start a thread - this keeps conversations grouped! If/when you start a thread, please be sure to click the button that shares responses with everyone in the class.



## What should you NOT worry about?

+ Attendance. There are no required in-person meeting times. As long as you get the work in on time, you'll be set.
+ Time to complete assignments. While there are deadlines, nothing will be within the context of a _timed_ Blackboard test. In other words, nothing will be a "do this in Blackboard and you get cut off in 45 minutes." Not happening.
+ If you get severely ill and are unable to complete assignments, please reach out to me ASAP. I may ask for a _brief_ video chat to confirm your circumstances. **Extensions will be liberally granted when they are appropriate.** Please do not assume an extension is granted unless I explicitly tell you so - asking for one is not the same as receiving one.
	+ If an extension is not feasible given the circumstances, there will be a possibility to exempt you from the given assignment entirely.
