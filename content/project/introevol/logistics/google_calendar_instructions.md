# Google Calendar Instructions

**Preface notes**

+ Use Google Chrome Browser (NOT internet explorer! NOT Safari!) from a COMPUTER (NOT a mobile device!!) for all calendar use. 
+ You must also be logged in to Chrome with your Rowan account to access the calendar.
+ I strongly recommend you add the Google Calendar app to your Slack. It will alert you of your appointments you make on Google Calendar, *and it will provide your video meeting link!*
+ Please refer all questions to the Slack channel `#logistical-questions`

1. Navigate to [https://calendar.google.com/calendar/](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/). Please ensure you have already added the class calendar to your account (see course website for link to join).

2. You will see two types of calendar events over the next several weeks:
	+ On Tuesday/Friday, there are "APPT ONLY Virtual office hours" which are designated with a small "checked" square icon. These are 1.5 hours long.
	+ On Wednesday there are open meeting times for the entire class to join (not strictly required, but highly recommended). Again, these are 1.5 hours long.

3. **For APPT ONLY meetings**, you can request one or more 15-minute blocks to video chat with me one-on-one. To book your meeting:
	+ Click the event itself within the calendar. In the pop-up window for the event, there will be a link that reads "Go to appointment page for this calendar". Click that link. 
	+ You will be redirected to a page displaying slots in 15-minute increments during the whole 1.5 hour window. Select one slot or two consecutive slots (more than 30 min. will be rejected to ensure enough time for other students; we will coordinate a separate time if you need more than 30 min) to reserve for a meeting. Click the meeting slot, and in the pop-up window that appears simply click "Save." At this point I will be notified that you have booked a meeting. 
	+ At the time of your meeting, return to the google calendar app and click on your appointment event, which will now exist as its own event within the main calendar page. Within your meeting details, there will be a new link called "Join Hangouts Meet". Simply click this button to automatically launch our Google Hangouts meeting! You will likely also receive an email notifying you of the Hangouts link.
	+ If you want to do this with MULTIPLE people, designate one person to make the appointment. They should share the Google Hangouts meeting link with other participants.
	+ Please note you will need to grant your browser permissions to access your webcam and/or microphone. These pop-ups requesting will likely appear the first time you join a meeting - please grant permissions! In addition, if you do NOT have a webcam, that is fine and this will still work!! It will just be a like a phone call meeting.

4. **For OPEN CLASS meetings** on Wednesdays, you should simply click the event within Google Calendar, and the link "Join Hangouts Meet" will be there. Join at any time during the 1.5 hour window!

5. If you would like to meet with me but those times do not work, OR you want a meeting >30 min long, please DM me on Slack and we will coordinate a separate meeting time.
