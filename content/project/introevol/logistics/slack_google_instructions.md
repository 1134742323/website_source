# Integrating Google Calendar with Slack

**Preface notes**

+ Use Google Chrome Browser (NOT internet explorer! NOT Safari!) from a COMPUTER (NOT a mobile device!!) for all calendar use. 
+ You must also be logged in to Chrome with your Rowan account to access the calendar.
+ Please refer all questions to the Slack channel `#logistical-questions`

**To do any of this, you must already have access to the class google calendar. Please join us using the link from the course website!**

1. Navigate to [https://slack.com/app-pages/google-calendar](https://slack.com/app-pages/google-calendar). Please ensure you have already added the class calendar to your account (see course website for link to join). This is the link to add the Google Calendar App to your Slack. Click the "Add to Slack" button and follow instructions, allowing permissions as you go.

2. Once you have added the app (again, do this on your COMPUTER - it's MUCH EASIER than mobile!), when you open Slack you will see a menu item on the left side at the very bottom, "Apps", which contains the now-installed app "Google Calendar." Click on Google Calendar.

3. You will now see the Google Calendar app within Slack. Click the big "Settings" button! Under "Accounts" within settings, click "Add Another Calendar." The class calendar will be listed there for you to add - but **only if you have already joined the calendar in the first place**.

And you should be good to go with seamless integration!!
