abstract = "We present a user-friendly exploratory network analysis platform called `dragon` (**D**eep-time **R**edox **A**nalysis of the **G**eobiology **O**ntology **N**etwork) to facilitate investigation of the expanding redox chemical network preserved in the mineral record throughout Earth's history and beyond. `dragon` is a browser-based open-source software written in R that, given a user-indicated element or set of focal elements, generates and analyzes interactive bipartite networks of minerals and their constituent elements over a specified range in deep-time. `dragon` allows users to fully customize network features, including node and edge visual attributes, and has convenient network export in a variety of formats for downstream use. We demonstrate the power of `dragon` to identify previously unrecognized trends in Earth's surface chemistry that have implications for the coevolution of the geosphere and biosphere using the Iron (Fe) mineral chemistry network over deep-time. `dragon` can be applied to any combination of elements to interrogate the evolving redox chemistry of the mineral record in deep-time and is freely available from CRAN under a GPL-3 License, with source code and usage instructions hosted at `https://github.com/spielmanlab/dragon`."
